# Bootstrapping Ubuntu Box

This is a hobby project to bootstrap a fresh installation of Ubuntu-based distros.

The main script `bootstrap.sh` will execute all scripts inside the folder `active`.

In case you want to skip any scripts, simply move them into the folder `inactive`.

Use it at your own risk.
